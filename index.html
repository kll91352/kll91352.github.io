		<p>I am apart of the Ignite Committee in Miracle and the purpose of this organization is to help raise money for the children's hospital. This is very important to me because I think it is crucial to support <I>Children's Healthcare of Atlanta</I> and help out the kids who are extremely sick. I was first exposed to dance marathon at my High School in Charleston, South Carolina. We called it Wandothon because I went to Wando High School. Dance Marathon is a 24 hour event full with activities and raising money. However, Wandothon was only 7 hours during the day but we still raised a lot of money!</p>
		<p>There are many Committee's in Miracle but the one with only freshman is Ignite, which is the one I am apart of. We meet every other Wednesday and talk about fundraising events that are coming up before dance marathon. In Ignite we have small events two months leading up to the event where we celebrate all of the money we have fundraised for the hospital.</p>
		<p>Some events and activities that we have already participated in to raise money is 100 Dollar Day and Ignite Olympics. 100 Dollar Day is when you have to raise 100 dollars in 24 hours. There are also color groups in Ignite so which ever color group raises the most amount of money gets a prize.</p>

		<H2> About My UGA Miracle Donor Drive</H2>
		<p>
		The way we raise money is through our UGA Miracle Donor Drives. The way I raise money is by sending emails out with a link to my page. This way they can donate to the organization. So far I have raised $102 but need to raise $500 by the time of Dance Marathon. This is the link to <A href="https://events.dancemarathon.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=donordrive.participant&amp;participantID=468075"> my donor page.</A>
